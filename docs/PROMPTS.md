## üí° Implementation Tips

### Using AI Responses
1. **Parse JSON**: When possible, request JSON formatted responses for easy integration
2. **Validate Output**: Always validate AI responses before using in-game
3. **Cache Results**: Store generated content to reduce API calls
4. **Fallback Options**: Have default content if AI generation fails

### Prompt Optimization
1. **Be Specific**: Clear constraints produce better results
2. **Provide Examples**: Show desired format in the prompt
3. **Set Limits**: Specify character/word limits for Discord
4. **Test Variations**: Try different phrasings for better results

### Integration Example
```javascript
async function generateQuest(level, playerClass) {
    const prompt = `Generate a quest for a level ${level} ${playerClass} character...`;
    
    try {
        const response = await aiService.generate(prompt);
        const quest = parseQuestResponse(response);
        
        // Validate quest data
        if (!quest.name || !quest.objectives) {
            return getDefaultQuest(level);
        }
        
        return quest;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Quest generation failed:', error);
        return getDefaultQuest(level);
    }
}
```
