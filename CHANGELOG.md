## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-06

### BREAKING CHANGES

‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Schema Breaking Change**: The `defense` column has been renamed to `constitution` in the `player_profiles` table. This requires fresh database setup.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed database column `player_profiles.defense` to `player_profiles.constitution`
- **BREAKING**: Updated TypeScript interface `PlayerProfile.defense` to `PlayerProfile.constitution`
- **BREAKING**: Sample armor items now use `constitution` stats instead of `defense`
- Profile command now displays "Constitution" and uses actual `constitution` database field
- Profile embed layout improved with better visual separation between sections
- Equipment section added to profile with weapon and armor display slots

### Added

- Equipment integration in profile command showing equipped weapons and armor
- Database methods for equipment management:
  - `getEquippedItems()` - Get all equipped items for a user
  - `getEquippedItemByType()` - Get equipped item of specific type
  - `equipItemExclusive()` - Equip item and auto-unequip others of same type
- Fresh database setup script `npm run setup:fresh-db` for constitution-based schema
- Comprehensive database setup documentation in README

### Removed

- Redundant database migration scripts (constitution setup uses fresh database only)
- Outdated `fixTables.ts` and related migration files
- Separate constitution documentation (consolidated into README)

### Fixed

- Profile emoji changed from sword (‚öîÔ∏è) to neutral person (üßë) in title
- Equipment display properly shows "None equipped" when no items are equipped
- All tests updated to work with constitution-based schema

### Migration Required

**For existing installations**: Run `npm run setup:fresh-db` to recreate database with constitution schema. This will clear existing data.
